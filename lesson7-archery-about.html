          <h2>School Background</h2>
          <p>Straight to the Point Archery is a non profit archery education center founded in 2005 by Giap Nguyen.  Our state of the art educational and training facility incorporates detailed technical video analysis combined with generations of archery experience from certified coaches and instructors.
            Straight to the Point Archery is an indoor training facility with  28 shooting (14 - 10 yard lanes and 14 - 20 yard lanes) and 2 private coaching rooms. We also have access to 26  additional  20 yard lanes  and an outdoor shooting field.  We offer several types of lessons to accommodate everyone from the first time archer to the professional archer. Once set up with proper fitting equipment, each archer will be given the basic safety instruction to start and will be introduced to various shooting techniques.
            From Beginner to Elite, archers of all ages and ability learn about this exciting Olympic and international sport. Sign up for a group lesson, private class, schedule a birthday or corporate party or compete at one of our many tournaments.

              <p>Giap started Straight to the Point Archery in 2005. He's an avid and accomplished archer himself, having competed with the United States Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics.
                He has three children, and  started Straight to the Point in part because he was not satisfied with the archery education options for them in Tacoma.
                After The Hunger Games books and movies came out, he noticed a surge in popularity of archery among young people, especially young women, and the business has been booming ever since.
