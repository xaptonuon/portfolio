      <p>For this lesson, I started experimenting with CSS. I'm learning CSS can get kind of complicated pretty quickly. I created a directory for an <a href="https://github.com/xaptonuon/portfolio/blob/master/styles/styles.css">external stylesheet </a>and used it to style my porftolio site. I need some cool content to fill this page so, here's a photo I took of some artwork I liked in a museum in NYC a few years ago... I think maybe it was at the Morgan Library & Museum-- I can't remember, and the photo isn't geotagged.</p>

    <h2>Interruptions, 1968. By Vera Molnar</h2>

    <img src="images/interruptions.jpg" width="500" alt="An art piece called Interruptions, 1968. By Vera Molnar">

    <p class="yellow-text">Molnar was one of the first artists to experiment with using computers to create drawings. 
    <p>To create this piece, she gained access to an IBM computer at a university in Paris in 1968. Using a basic program of her own creation, she blindly punched data into a card and printed the results onto a plotter, resulting in this abstract piece--which was abhored by the artistic community at the time.</p>
