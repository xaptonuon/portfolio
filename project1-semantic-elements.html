      <p style="color: blue">In web development, a <b>semantic</b> html element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
        In other words, semantic elements have better form <i>and</i> function, providing more purposeful html tags that are easily
        interpreted by humans and machines alike. It's a best practice nowadays for web developers to use semantic elements,
        versus having <em>too many</em> nested and unnecessary div elements plastered all over an html document. Non-semantic elements
        such as div elements, or &lt;div&gt; tags, are basically page dividers that break up web page content into specific sections, but they
        <u>don't provide any information about the content!</u> These &lt;div&gt; tags have been a quick, go-to element for when web developers need to
        divide content for styling or structural purposes. Moving forward, it would behoove web developers to make more use of <b>semantic</b>
        elements since they improve webpage accessibility, searchability, and interoperability.</p>
