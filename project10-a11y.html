          <h2>Updatin my mock-sties with A11y in mind</h2>
            <p>I concentrated on 3 key areas for accessibility updates for both of my mock websites:</p>
            
            <p><strong>Alt Text.</strong> For people with visual impairments that use screen readers, the alt tags are read out loud, 
              so users know what the image is. Improved alt tags basically increase accessibility and also giving 
              search engines more information to crawl. When I initially created my mock sites,
               I poorly described my images in the alternative text, so I went through both the html for both websites 
               and provided more descriptive, informative text for every image.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Link Accessibility. </strong>Link accessibility is another important aspect of a11y usability--and I found there are all
               sorts of techniques for this. During the screen reader exercise,
                I found that navigating to and opening links was frustrating at times. 
                In an attempt to simulate visual impairment, rather than full blindness, 
                I would just barely open my eyes so that my vision was lessened—blurry at best. 
                I implemented some styling techniques in my mock websites that I thought would help the visually impaired. 
                I implemented a hover class for links that would both 1) highlight the background of the link and 2) increase 
                the text size by 150%, and 3) I also added some extra padding and margin to space header/footer links out a bit more. 
                Another technique for link accessibility I discovered through WebAIM was adding a small icon after each external link. 
                The idea is that the icon not only serves as an extra visual signifier but also clearly distinguishes between external 
                and internal links. Since my mock websites don’t have much, if any, in the way of external content, 
                for demonstrative purposes I added a link icon to weblinks in my html documents using Font Awesome for various links.
                 Finally, I a considered how to make my links more readable by screen readers. A human readable link is more user-friendly than a link with excessive alphanumeric characters, slashes, question marks, symbols, etc. I ensured links used human-friendly text instead of URLs.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Skip to Main/Quick Navigation.</strong> I added a skip link as the first interactive element on the main page
               of each mock site. It takes the user to what I’ve ID’d as the main content, past the global elements 
               like the logo and navigation components. It’s hidden until it is focused on. 
               Like the other accessibility features, this functionality wasn’t something 
               I appreciated until I did the screen reader exercise. 
               Specifically, I can see how being able to jump to the main content might help disabled people 
               who rely on tactile input devices that may want to jump to the meat of the matter on a website.
