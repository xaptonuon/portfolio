          <h2>Hi there! My name is Neil.</h2>
            <p>I live in Washington State, where I work in State Government as a GIS Analyst. I use a variety 
                of software applications on my job--mostly low code stuff, and decided I would like to up my game and 
                rely less on tools with a graphical user interface and develop GIS products more from coding. I like 
                retro technology and space age stuff, so you'll see a lot of that as imagery throughout my portfolio.</p>
