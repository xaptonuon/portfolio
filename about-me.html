  <h1>About Neil</h1>
  <p>My name is Neil and I live in Washington State. I work in State Government as a GIS Analyst. I use a variety 
      of software applications on my job--mostly low code stuff, and decided I would like up my game and 
      rely less on tools with a graphical user interface and develop GIS products more from coding. I like 
      retro technology and space age stuff, so you'll see a lot of that as imagery throughout my portfolio.</p>
